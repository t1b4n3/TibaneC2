# TibaneC2 - Command & Control Framework

**TibaneC2** is a fully custom-built Command & Control (C2) framework designed for offensive security research, red teaming, and adversary simulation. It includes a native C/C++ core server, a PHP-based web panel, a CLI console, cross-platform implants, multi-language stagers, and scripting tools for automation and emulation.

[Already have basic C2 implementation](./BasicC2/README.md)

## Project Components

| Component      | Language(s)                     | Description |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Core Server** | C                           | Central server that communicates with implants and operator interfaces |
| **Web Panel**   | PHP                              | Web-based control interface for managing agents and sending tasks |
| **CLI Console** | C++                               | Terminal-based operator tool for environments without a GUI |
| **Implants**    | C, C++ ,Python, Powershell, Bash                            | Persistent agents that execute commands and exfiltrate data |
| **Stagers**     | Assembly, C, Python, Bash, PowerShell | Lightweight loaders to deploy implants |
| **Database**    | MySQL              | Tracks agents, tasks, results, logs |
| **Automation**  | Python / Bash                    | Tools for payload generation, system health checks, and threat simulation |

## Features

- Multi-agent support with task queueing
- CLI and Web-based control interfaces
- Encrypted C2 communication (planned: AES/TLS)
- File upload/download and command execution
- Stagers for rapid deployment
- Persistent implant options (Windows & Linux)
- Central logging, audit trail, and command results
- Payload obfuscation and delivery automation


## Getting Started

### 1. Build the Core Server
```bash
cd core
make
./c2_server
```

### 2. Run the Web Panel
Host PHP files via Apache/Nginx or PHP’s built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 -t panel/
```

## OR

### 2. Run the CLI Console

```bash
cd cli
make
./console
```

### 3. Deploy an Implant
Compile or obfuscate from implants/

Use stagers/ to deliver the payload



## Database Schema (example)
agents (id, hostname, os, last_seen, ip)

tasks (id, agent_id, command, status, result)

logs (timestamp, type, message)

## Tooling & Automation
Script	Description
payload_generator.py	Generate obfuscated payloads
health_check.sh	Check server and DB health
emulator.py	Simulate agent traffic

🧪 Development Roadmap
 Core TCP server

 Web interface integration

 CLI console tool

 Implant command execution

 File transfer

 Encrypted comms (AES/TLS)

 HTTP/S-based fallback C2

 Anti-analysis and OPSEC evasion

 SOCKS proxy tunneling

 Plugin-based extension system
