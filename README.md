# TibaneC2 - Command & Control Framework

**TibaneC2** is a fully custom-built Command & Control (C2) framework designed for offensive security research, red teaming, and adversary simulation. It includes a native C/C++ core server, a PHP-based web panel, a CLI console, cross-platform implants, multi-language stagers, and scripting tools for automation and emulation.

> ⚠️ For educational and authorized testing purposes only.

[Already have basic C2 implementation](./BasicC2/README.md) 

### First Release Scheduled For 30 August 2025

The goal is to keep the C2 framework modular by splitting it into clear components, where each component will follow a defined interface so I can swap or add features easily, That way i can extend it without touching the core logic.

[Getting Started](./docs/Getting%20Started.md)

## Project Components

| Component      | Language(s)                     | Description |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Core Server** | C                           | Central server that communicates with implants and operator interfaces |
| **Web Panel**   | PHP                              | Web-based control interface for managing agents and sending tasks |
| **CLI Console** | C++                               | Terminal-based operator tool for environments without a GUI |
| **Implants**    | C, C++ ,Python, Powershell, Bash                            | Persistent agents that execute commands and exfiltrate data |
| **Stagers**     | Assembly, C, Python, Bash, PowerShell | Lightweight loaders to deploy implants |
| **Database**    | MySQL              | Tracks agents, tasks, results, logs |
| **Automation**  | Python / Bash                    | Tools for payload generation, system health checks, and threat simulation |

## Features

- Multi-agent support with task queueing
- CLI and Web-based control interfaces
- Encrypted C2 communication (planned: AES/TLS)
- File upload/download and command execution
- Stagers for rapid deployment
- Persistent implant options (Windows & Linux)
- Central logging, audit trail, and command results
- Payload obfuscation and delivery automation


## Communication Methods

- **Custom TCP communication:** Communicates via custom tcp and sends data via json
### Planned
- **Encrypted TCP Communication:** Encrypt communications (ssl/tls)
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Web traffic to blend in with normal traffic

---

## TODO
### Core server
- Session mode
- HTTP/HTTPS Communication methods

### Implants
- keylogger
- screenshot capture
- file upload/download
- sandbox and vm detection checks
- kill switch for self-removal
- persistence mechanisms
